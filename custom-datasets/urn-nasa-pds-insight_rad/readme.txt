Mars InSight Lander Radiometer Data Archive

This bundle contains the following collections:

- data_raw: InSight raw radiometer data
- data_calibrated: InSight calibrated radiometer data
- data_derived: InSight derived radiometer data

Each document and data product in this bundle is described by a PDS4
label in a separate file with the same name but with the extension XML.
PDS4 labels are XML (eXtended Markup Language) files that conform to the
PDS4 Information Model XML schema at
https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/schema/released/. They are best viewed in an
XML-aware text editor, and may be used by software that can manipulate
XML documents.

See these sources for more information.

- For information about PDS4, see https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/about/. 
- For information about the InSight mission or the Radiometer
experiment, see the InSight document bundle

This bundle was created by the HP3/RAD Science Team and archived at the
